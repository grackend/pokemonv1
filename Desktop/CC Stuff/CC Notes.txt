implicit bias branches

you get credit for taking this quiz, not for what answers you put down. Name, uniqname, class you’re in (183, 101, 151).

- maybe I have a computing bias - already done 
make them think about how the target feels and how we can make life better for them? How can we improve their experience (context of class/professional? maybe context of class) do you see any of these biases in class? 
- mention a few names of the women in the quiz - some kind of basic check that they took the quiz.

Do this by Oct 6!!!
