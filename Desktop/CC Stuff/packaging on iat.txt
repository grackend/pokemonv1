About the IAT (Implicit Association Test)

The IAT measures attitudes and beliefs that people may be unwilling or unable to report. It measures strength of associations between concepts (e.g., black people, gay people) and evaluations (e.g. good, bad) or stereotypes (e.g. athletic, clumsy). This test is to develop personal awareness of implicit preferences and stereotypes.

We will NOT be asking for your results. The goal is only to encourage personal examination of your implicit preferences and stereotypes. You will get credit for taking this quiz, not for the answers that you put down.

It is important to note that an implicit stereotype is one that occurs outside of conscious awareness and control. It is normal and okay to have implicit stereotypes. The goal of this test is not to make anyone feel guilty, it is only to raise awareness of the personal unconscious biases you may possess. (Again, it is okay to have these biases- they are almost inescapable in our society. It is not okay to consciously act on them.)

What can I do about an implicit preference that I don’t want?
Keep in mind that the IATs on the website might not be perfectly accurate. That said, it is very possible to have an implicit preference that you don’t want. One solution is to seek experiences that could reverse or undo the patterns that created the unwanted preference. For example, you could choose to avoid watching television shows that promote negative stereotypes of women or minorities. You could read materials that oppose the implicit preference. You could interact with people or learn about people who counter your implicit stereotypes. You can work to remain alert to the existence of the unwanted implicit preference to make sure that it doesn’t influence your overt behavior. You can also try consciously planned actions that will compensate for your implicit preferences. For example, if you have an implicit preference for young people you can try to be friendlier toward elderly people. Research shows that implicit preferences are quite malleable so it is possible to manage and change them if you want to.
